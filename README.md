# Geometric Field Theory of Consciousness (GFTC) - Numerical Toy Model

This repository contains the numerical implementation and experiments for the **Geometric Field Theory of Consciousness (GFTC)**, a novel framework modeling consciousness as a geometric order emerging from coupled fields.

## 🌟 Key Findings
- **Critical Phenomenon**: Consciousness coupling strength (`λ_c`) drives a **phase transition** from disorder to order.
- **Synergistic Effect**: The emergence depends on the synergy between neural excitability (`μ`) and global coupling (`λ_c`), as revealed in a 2D phase diagram.
- **Geometric Structure**: The ordered phase exhibits stable **vortex patterns** in the conscious field (`A_μ`).

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
- `scripts/`: Core simulation codes.
- `figures/`: Generated high-quality figures.
- `notebooks/`: Interactive demonstrations.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Clone & Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GFTC-Consciousness-Field-Theory.git
   cd GFTC-Consciousness-Field-Theory
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Run the Core Experiment (Phase Transition):
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_phase_transition.py
   ```
2. Generate the 2D Phase Diagram:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_2d_phase_diagram.py
   ```
